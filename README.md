# x-ray_classification

Using the Keras module in Tensorflow, this classification model was made to identify pneumonia, COVID-19, or no issues in chest x-rays. 

Using a training set and a validation set of image data, the images were pre-processed and put through a basic model. They were then fitted with the training set and tested with the validation set. There are plots at the end to represent the cross-entropy loss for training and validation data over each epoch, as well as AUC metrics for both data sets as well. Finally, there is additionally a classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of the neural network.
